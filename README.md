Transportation Asset Management Software

Utah LTAP has developed software for asset management.  TAMS (Transportation Asset Management System) is designed for Utah's cities and towns.  It favors quick data collection and good-enough analysis -- and doesn't require extensive training.  

## Asphalt/Road Condition & Inventory
Road condition is measured using a simple "windshield" review; and a Remaing Service Life (RSL) grade is calculated.   TAMS can provide an over-all analysis of a street network.  It can help city officials create an effective road maintenance program and budget for efficient use of tax dollars.
